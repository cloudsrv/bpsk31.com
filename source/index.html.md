PSK31 is a digital communication mode for amateur radio. It is one of the most common and easy-to-use digital modes as a PSK31 station needs only to consist of an SSB transceiver, an antenna, and a soundcard equipped PC.

This website is a basic resource covering [what is PSK31](/about/), how to [set up and operate your own station](/operation/), some [available software](/apps/), and [additional resources](/resources/).

We also operate an [email discussion list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/bpsk31) as a community resource where you can ask questions of other Hams and generally discuss anything related to PSK31.

Feel free to post any comments or suggestions about this website to that email list as well - this is a community resource and we would love to integrate your feedback into the site.
